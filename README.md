# Template1
This is a template created from the website design of anmol.pro

Feel free to use and modify if you want, it isn't working that well though.

Ensure you have node.js installed on your device.

The code uses the ***__express__*** package to create a server, ensure you have that.

Just do `node server` in the main directory `Template1` and then open `localhost:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080` or any valid url that points to the server running.
